# HLSL-Graphics-Effects

A variety of graphical effects implemented using hlsl shader programming in a UWP application. This application was built up from the UWP tutorial, and as such, a large portion of the C++ UWP code was not written by me but was sourced from the tutorial. The majority of the code written by me is included inside the Sample3DSceneRenderer cpp/h files and of course the hlsl shader files.
